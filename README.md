Library for simulating physical forces on particles.
Heavily inspired by [`d3-force`](https://d3js.org/d3-force).

> :warning: This library is currently under development so the API is still likely to change.

We currently support the following forces:

* Collide
* Link
* ManyBody
* PositionX and PositionY
